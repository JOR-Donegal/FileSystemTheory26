# Introduction

!!! abstract "File System Theory"

The first computers I used loaded programmes and data directly off magnetic tape. As the data was laid out in sequence from the start of the tape to the end, we referred to tape solutions as linear. And linear solutions are still used for backup and archiving purposes.

Once floppy disks became available, we moved to file systems.

And once hard disks became available, we moved to complex filesystems with features to enhance security, availability and durability or the data.
